I just want to write down a couple of thoughts before I forget.</p>\n<h4 id=\"xcode-15\">Xcode 15</h4>\n<p>Xcode 15 is buggy as hell. Running an emulator or preview <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/731219\">makes my machine overheat</a>. As of this writing, I am on the second beta release of Xcode 15, and still have the same overheating issue.</p>\n<h4 id=\"betas\">Betas</h4>\n<p>I installed the beta releases right away, iOS 17 and, Sonoma. My first actually. So I ended up not being able to release new versions on Xcode 14. Luckily, we are currently rewriting the app for the upcoming version of iOS and iPadOS 17. Remind me next time not to do this shit again.</p>\n<h4 id=\"notes-codeblock\">Notes codeblock</h4>\n<p>Notes has already the long-awaited code block feature. For me, it is a sort of a code block-ish attempt, Apple called it <code>monostyled</code>. Now my code won&rsquo;t look awkward anymore on my notes.</p>\n<h4 id=\"symbols-5\">Symbols 5</h4>\n<p>It has been a joy to use Symbols 5 with its animations. But, I wish <code>symbolEffect()</code> will work inside <code>TabView</code>. I haven&rsquo;t yet figured out how to make it work.</p>\n<h4 id=\"assets-static-access\">Assets static access</h4>\n<p>One of the best lowkey features of Xcode 15, I don&rsquo;t have to risk misspelling my assets while accessing them in my code.</p>\n<h4 id=\"others\">Others</h4>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to play with SwiftUI animations, SwiftData, and the not yet released TipKit.

I was too busy catching up with the WWDC sessions and some fatherly stuff I have to deal with.\n\nOverall, I am impressed by the event and the news coming out of it. I just want to write down a couple of thoughts before I forget.\n\n#### Xcode 15\n\nXcode 15 is buggy as hell. Running an emulator or preview [makes my machine overheat](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/731219). As of this writing, I am on the second beta release of Xcode 15, and still have the same overheating issue.\n\n#### Betas\n\nI installed the beta releases right away, iOS 17 and, Sonoma. My first actually. So I ended up not being able to release new versions on Xcode 14. Luckily, we are currently rewriting the app for the upcoming version of iOS and iPadOS 17. Remind me next time not to do this shit again.\n\n#### Notes codeblock\n\nNotes has already the long-awaited code block feature. For me, it is a sort of a code block-ish attempt, Apple called it `monostyled`. Now my code won't look awkward anymore on my notes.\n\n#### Symbols 5\n\nIt has been a joy to use Symbols 5 with its animations. But, I wish `symbolEffect()` will work inside `TabView`. I haven't yet figured out how to make it work.\n\n#### Assets static access\n\nOne of the best lowkey features of Xcode 15, I don't have to risk misspelling my assets while accessing them in my code.\n\n#### Others\n\nI can't wait to play with SwiftUI animations, SwiftData, and the not yet released TipKit. And Macros. \n\n",

And use `.navigationDestination()` instead of `NavigationLink`.\n\n```\n@State private var goToSettings = false\n\nNavigationStack {\n   ZStack {\n      // Some more codes\n   }\n   .toolbar {\n      Button(role: .destructive, action: {\n         goToSettings = true\n      }) {\n         Label(\"Settings\", systemImage: \"gearshape.fill\").foregroundColor(colorForeground)\n      }\n   }\n   .navigationDestination(isPresented: $goToSettings, destination: {\n       SettingsView()\n    })\n}\n```\n\nI need to get more familiar with SwiftUI's modifiers as it is still a little confusing for me.\n",

This time it is from a popular grocery chain in the Philippines.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67704/2022/f81b022846.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" alt=\"\" />\n\nYou can sign up freely on RaidForums if you want, it is free. But I don't believe you won't find any links to download the database dump since it is only available to members with huge reputations.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'm not sure if the database dumps in RaidForums are legit but it certainly looked like one. I wonder if both NBI Cybersecurity Team or DICT found this forum.\n\nIt took me no less than 20 minutes for this investigation.\n\n----\n\nThis was their first Facebook post I guess.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67704/2022/c9484d087d.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"1298\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI forgot what Philippine agency I messaged on Messenger, but I was only \"seen\". I did not get any reply. I believed I also sent a message to the group but deleted it right away because I was scared of the magnitude of this incident.\n\nIt sucks I was only able to grab a couple of screenshots of the whole ordeal.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67704/2022/b823a4a4bf.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"335\" alt=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67704/2022/c96ae686ee.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"288\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI feel safe posting this now since my hunch was validated by their arrests. It was great to be somewhat part of this history, something I will tell my grandkids someday. Anyway, kudos to the Philippines cybercrime agencies working behind the scenes to get those scums arrested.\n",

We decided to bring Lucas to Ayala for the first time in more than 2 years.</p>\n<h4 id=\"playhouse\">Playhouse</h4>\n<p>It was Luke&rsquo;s first time playing in Ayala&rsquo;s Playhouse. Or his first time since the pandemic to play in a kid&rsquo;s public playhouse. We weren&rsquo;t sure what to expect when we arrived. First few minutes, Luke&rsquo;s uneasiness was apparent.</p>\n<p>The playhouse wasn&rsquo;t huge compared to Kidzona (the playhouse near our place). We were also expecting a slow day, but there were around 4-5 kids playing, and Luke is not yet accustomed to playing around with kids.</p>\n<p>A few minutes in, Luke was still uncomfortable and doesn&rsquo;t like to be put down on the floor. But we were able to find his spot.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Luke also explored the other sections and toys in the playhouse. At one point there were kids playing near him, but he didn&rsquo;t fuss or anything. He just continued to play. We were so happy and proud of our little kiddo! Luke also got to play inside the playhouse with Nice and Juretz!</p>\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t last the whole hour since Luke got bored. As I was saying, the playhouse wasn&rsquo;t that big and several of the toys have been damaged already.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toy-shopping\">Toy Shopping</h4>\n<p>Part of our agenda on that day was to buy toys for Luke. We went around Rustan&rsquo;s toys section and Toys-R-Us.  I was half-joking the other day that I would buy the first toy that Luke would show interest in or point to. Seconds into the Rustan&rsquo;s store and Luke found the first toy he liked! That was quick lol! And more importantly, the toy was within our budget.</p>\n<p>But my wife&rsquo;s sister and his husband were the ones who paid for the toy. Thank you so much!</p>\n<p>We went to Toys-R-Us after to look for his second toy. In the same scenario, it did not take too long for Luke to find another toy. He likes toys that are either alphabet, words, or numbers. And both of the toys he chose are in tablet form.</p>\n<h4 id=\"lunch-and-poop\">Lunch and poop</h4>\n<p>While we were waiting for our lunch orders, Luke pooped publicly. Luckily we were able to bring diapers. It was funny and at the same time, we were glad that he pooped since his mood will mostly depend on his comfort.</p>\n<p>Lunch was great! It has an open sitting concept and more space for Lucas.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"wwdc-2022\">WWDC 2022</h4>\n<p>My work week was consumed mostly by Apple&rsquo;s WWDC 2022 event. This is for another post, but I hope this time I will be able to catch up with most of the concepts and labs, and new stuff. At last year&rsquo;s WWDC I was only able to watch the Keynote and a couple of developer videos.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4 id=\"buffet-with-family\">Buffet with Family</h4>\n<p>Yesterday, we celebrated Father&rsquo;s day in advance.

				"content_text": "A lot has happened this week.\n\n#### Wedding Anniversary\n\nLast Thursday was our wedding anniversary. We decided to bring Lucas to Ayala for the first time in more than 2 years.\n\n#### Playhouse\n\nIt was Luke's first time playing in Ayala's Playhouse. Or his first time since the pandemic to play in a kid's public playhouse. We weren't sure what to expect when we arrived. First few minutes, Luke's uneasiness was apparent. \n\nThe playhouse wasn't huge compared to Kidzona (the playhouse near our place). We were also expecting a slow day, but there were around 4-5 kids playing, and Luke is not yet accustomed to playing around with kids.\n\nA few minutes in, Luke was still uncomfortable and doesn't like to be put down on the floor. But we were able to find his spot.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67704/2022/d8d3d19578.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\" />\n\nLuke also explored the other sections and toys in the playhouse. At one point there were kids playing near him, but he didn't fuss or anything. He just continued to play. We were so happy and proud of our little kiddo! Luke also got to play inside the playhouse with Nice and Juretz!\n\nWe didn't last the whole hour since Luke got bored. As I was saying, the playhouse wasn't that big and several of the toys have been damaged already.\n\n#### Toy Shopping\n\nPart of our agenda on that day was to buy toys for Luke. We went around Rustan's toys section and Toys-R-Us.  I was half-joking the other day that I would buy the first toy that Luke would show interest in or point to. Seconds into the Rustan's store and Luke found the first toy he liked! That was quick lol! And more importantly, the toy was within our budget. \n\nBut my wife's sister and his husband were the ones who paid for the toy. Thank you so much! \n\nWe went to Toys-R-Us after to look for his second toy. In the same scenario, it did not take too long for Luke to find another toy. He likes toys that are either alphabet, words, or numbers. And both of the toys he chose are in tablet form. \n\n#### Lunch and poop\n\nWhile we were waiting for our lunch orders, Luke pooped publicly. Luckily we were able to bring diapers. It was funny and at the same time, we were glad that he pooped since his mood will mostly depend on his comfort.\n\nLunch was great! It has an open sitting concept and more space for Lucas. \n\n---\n\n#### WWDC 2022\n\nMy work week was consumed mostly by Apple's WWDC 2022 event. This is for another post, but I hope this time I will be able to catch up with most of the concepts and labs, and new stuff. At last year's WWDC I was only able to watch the Keynote and a couple of developer videos.\n\n---\n\n#### Buffet with Family\n\nYesterday, we celebrated Father's day in advance. We went back to Ferias at Radisson Hotel for their lunch buffet. For the first time in this vacation, Lucas allowed himself to sit on my lap. All he wants is to watch YouTube on my phone and play with his new toy which we bought the day before.\n\nFor the first time, I was able to eat in peace publicly with Luke. Also, he ran a lot in the lobby, in the restaurant, and in the hotel garden.\n\nThis is just halfway into our month-long vacation, I and my wife are very impressed with how Luke grew up and adjusted.\n\nHere's Lucas running away from the restaurant. 😂\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67704/2022/d11b5fdb6f.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"943\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n",

But I found out, that this won't work when using SwiftUI.\n\n```swift\n\nextension MyJobsViewController: WKNavigationDelegate {\n}\n\n```\n\nAfter further Googling, research and internet digging I learned that I need to use [makeCoordinator()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/uiviewcontrollerrepresentable/makecoordinator()-32trb) function.\n\n> Creates the custom instance that you use to communicate changes from your view controller to other parts of your SwiftUI interface.\n\nFirst, I wrote an inner class called `Coordinator`.\n\n```swift\n\nclass Coordinator: NSObject, WKNavigationDelegate {\n        let parent: OnlineJobsWebView\n        \n        init(_ parent: OnlineJobsWebView) {\n            self.parent = parent\n        }\n        \n        func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) {\n            webView.evaluateJavaScript(Keys.javascriptRemoveElements, completionHandler: {\n                _, error in\n            })\n        }\n}\n\n```\n\nThen in the main class\n\n```swift\n\nstruct OnlineJobsWebView: NSViewRepresentable {\n\n     func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {\n        Coordinator(self)\n    }\n\n     var url: URL\n    \n    func makeNSView(context: Context) -> WKWebView {\n        return WKWebView()\n    }\n\n    func updateNSView(_ webView: WKWebView, context: Context) {\n        webView.navigationDelegate = context.coordinator\n        // Evaluate Javascript will now work at this point.\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\nThis implementation feels a little hacky. Why wouldn't Apple just introduce a `WebView` for SwiftUI? Going through all this is just painful. \n\n![Hide the pain](https://media.giphy.com/media/7T33BLlB7NQrjozoRB/giphy.gif)\n",

Ukraine is one of the top, if not the top destination for IT outsourcing, so this is a long-term issue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The global market for IT services has exploded in line with the overall growth of tech, which has become a $4 trillion dollar industry.

As you noticed we shouldn't use the bottom constraint because once we implement the scale or translate animation it will hold off and pull down the UIButton back to its proper place regardless of its size. What we would like to do is for UIButton to maintain its screen position regardless of its size.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So let's add a container UIView that will house our UIButton. Drag another UIView and this time make sure it fills up the majority of the bottom area. In the Size Inspector the values should be: x=4, y=741, width=406, height=100. After, add the necessary constraints as you see fit. Place the UIButton inside this newly added container UIView. It should look like the one below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":138,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/67704/2022/71952275e3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-138\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Update the UIButton constraints with both vertically and horizontally constraints.

Drag a UIView inside the container UIView and behind the UIButton and make sure it is much more larger in terms of width and height. Set both width and height to 80. For our border UIView, add the following width and height constraints and also the horizontally and vertically constraint, same with our UIButton.
